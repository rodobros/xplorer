Description:
This is an android application that uses google map API to create a game of cold and hot. The user chooses a picture from a list and has to try to find the corresponding location with limited amount of times and tries. The project could be expanded. The most obvious place to expand would be to have a dynamic rather than static list of location.

Aim:
This was a project to learn android programming and using google map API as a team of four people.
